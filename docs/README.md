# 3D Rubik's Cube Simulation

A fully functional 3D Rubik's Cube simulation built with Three.js. Features smooth animations, scramble functionality, auto-solve capability, keyboard controls, and orientation-aware move system.

## Features

- 🎮 **Interactive 3D Cube** - Rotate the view by dragging with your mouse or touch
- 🔄 **Zoom Control** - Scroll to zoom in and out
- 🎲 **Scramble** - Randomly scramble the cube with 20 moves
- ✨ **Auto-Solve** - Watch the cube solve itself automatically by reversing scramble moves
- 🔁 **Reset** - Return the cube to its solved state instantly
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Controls** - Use R, U, D, L, F, B keys for moves (Shift for prime moves)
- 🧭 **Orientation-Aware Moves** - Keyboard moves are relative to current view orientation
- 🎨 **Front Face Indicator** - Visual indicator showing which face is currently facing front
- 📊 **Status Display** - Real-time status updates during operations
- 📱 **Touch Support** - Full touch support for mobile devices
- 🎬 **Smooth Animations** - Eased animations with queue system for sequential moves

**Note**: The codebase has been refactored to follow SOLID principles. See [SOLID_REFACTORING.md](SOLID_REFACTORING.md) for detailed documentation on the architectural improvements.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Use the buttons or keyboard to interact:
   - **Scramble** - Mix up the cube randomly with 20 moves
   - **Solve** - Auto-solve the cube by reversing the scramble moves
   - **Reset** - Reset to the solved state instantly

## Controls

### Mouse/Touch Controls
- **Drag** - Rotate the cube view (works with mouse or touch)
- **Scroll** - Zoom in/out (mouse wheel or pinch gesture)
- **Cmd/Ctrl + Drag** - Lock cube and swipe to rotate individual faces (like two-finger touch on mobile)

### Keyboard Controls
- **R, U, D, L, F, B** - Rotate the corresponding face (relative to current view)
- **Shift + Key** - Perform prime (counter-clockwise) move
- Moves are orientation-aware: pressing 'F' always rotates the face currently facing you

### Button Controls
- **Scramble** - Randomly scrambles the cube with 20 moves
- **Solve** - Automatically solves the cube by reversing scramble moves
- **Reset** - Instantly resets to solved state

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The application follows a **modular architecture with SOLID principles**:

- **Three.js v0.128.0** - Loaded via CDN for 3D rendering
- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - `cube.js` - Pure cube logic (state, moves, algorithms) - 372 lines
  - `script.js` - Main application integration - 1689 lines
  - **SOLID Modules** (NEW):
    - `cubeRenderer.js` - Rendering abstraction (DIP)
    - `rotationStrategy.js` - Strategy pattern for rotation (OCP)
    - `uiController.js` - UI management (SRP)
    - `cameraController.js` - Camera controls (SRP)
    - `highlightManager.js` - Visual feedback (SRP)
    - `touchHandler.js` - Gesture handling (SRP)
- **RubiksCube Class** - Encapsulates all cube operations with a clean API
- **3x3x3 Cube Model** - 27 individual cubies (3×3×3 grid)
- **Animation System** - Queue-based system prevents move conflicts
- **Move History** - Tracks all moves for auto-solve functionality

See [SOLID_REFACTORING.md](SOLID_REFACTORING.md) for detailed architectural documentation.

### Benefits of the Modular Design

1. **Maintainability**: Cube logic and UI code are independent
2. **Testability**: Cube logic can be tested without UI
3. **Reusability**: Modules can work with different rendering systems
4. **Clarity**: Well-defined API between modules
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features to any module
6. **SOLID Principles**: Architecture follows industry best practices
   - **SRP**: Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
   - **OCP**: Open for extension, closed for modification (Strategy pattern)
   - **DIP**: Depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations

For detailed SOLID principles documentation, see [SOLID_REFACTORING.md](SOLID_REFACTORING.md).

### Cube Colors (Standard Rubik's Cube)
- **White** - Up face (Y+)
- **Yellow** - Down face (Y-)
- **Red** - Right face (X+)
- **Orange** - Left face (X-)
- **Blue** - Front face (Z+)
- **Green** - Back face (Z-)

### Move Notation
Standard Rubik's cube notation:
- **R, L, U, D, F, B** - Clockwise rotations
- **R', L', U', D', F', B'** - Counter-clockwise (prime) rotations

### Key Components

- **Move execution**: Standard notation (R, L, U, D, F, B and primes)
- **Face rotation**: Animation and position tracking
- **Scramble algorithm**: Random 20-move scrambling
- **Solve algorithm**: Reverse move history to solve
- **Cubie management**: Type detection (center, edge, corner)
- **Exported constants**: Colors, moves, dimensions

#### `script.js` (1724 lines)
- **Scene setup**: Three.js initialization (scene, camera, renderer, lighting)
- **User interaction**: Mouse/touch controls for rotating view
- **Face swiping**: Touch and modifier key (Ctrl/Cmd) controls
- **Raycasting**: Detecting which face is clicked/touched
- **Visual feedback**: Highlighting, front face indicator
- **Keyboard controls**: Orientation-aware move mapping
- **Integration**: Creates and manages RubiksCube instance
- **Animation loop**: Rendering the 3D scene

#### `styles.css` (152 lines)
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Gradient backgrounds and button styling
- Fixed UI overlays (controls, status, instructions)
- Front face indicator styling
- AI test banner styling

#### `index.html` (39 lines)
- Semantic HTML structure
- UI elements (buttons, status, instructions, indicators)
- Three.js CDN integration
- Script loading order (Three.js → cube.js → script.js)
- Viewport meta tag for mobile support

### Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support:
- WebGL
- ES6 JavaScript features
- CSS3 (gradients, transforms, backdrop-filter)

### Performance

- Smooth 60fps animations
- Efficient cubie management
- Optimized rendering with antialiasing
